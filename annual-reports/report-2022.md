# QuTiP 2022 Annual Report

Dear QuTiP community,

This last year has again been very productive and successful for QuTiP.

In addition to the usual releases and bug fixes, there has been a big increase
in community events and engagement with QuTiP being showcased at both SciPy and
ASQSQIS, continued fruitful participation in Google Summer of Code and
UnitaryHACK, and a revamp of the QuTiP tutorials which are many users primary
resource when learning QuTiP.

Pleasingly, 2022 has seen a large increase in the number of downloads of QuTiP,
with both the `qutip` and `qutip_qip` packages more than doubling their total
number of downloads.

The end of the year saw the release of **QuTiP 5 alpha**. This a massive
milestone for the community and represents three years of work by members of the
admin team and numerous contributors.

We've summarized the year below, providing short descriptions, links and
statistics where possible.

Thank you again to everyone who contributed this year -- whether by writing
code, filing bug reports, asking or answering questions on the mailing list or
simply using QuTiP. You are all part of our community and much appreciated.

Best wishes and happy quantuming,

The QuTiP Admin Team

## Major improvements

- QuTiP 5.0.0a1 released.

- The tutorials were updated to support both QuTiP 5 and QuTiP 4.7, and are now tested nightly to ensure they don't become outdated in the future.

- Nightly benchmarks were implemented for the QuTiP 5 data layer and solvers.

- The remaining solvers were ported to the new QuTiP 5 solver interface, including the Monte-Carlo, Bloch-Redfield, Kyrlov Subspace, Floquet, HEOM, and Evolution of State solvers. Related functionality including the calculation of propagators, steady states and correlation functions were also migrated.

- Integration tests for Windows were activated and Windows is now a fully supported platform.

- Support for Apple M1 was added and binaries packages for the Apple M1 are available from conda-forge.

- QuTiP was compiled for Web Assembly and can be run natively inside a browser. A compiled package is available from emscripten-forge.

- Support has been added for 64-bit integer sparse matrix indices.

- The Krylov subspace and Hierarchical Equations of Motion (HEOM) solvers were released.

## Upcoming Projects & Ideas for the Future

- We expect 4.7.2 and 5.0.0 to be released in the first half of 2023.

- We expect QuTiP 5 to undergo a period of stabilization, bug fixing and polishing as more people start using it.

- We expect `qutip.control` to be moved to its own family package before the 5.0.0 release.

- We expect QuTiP 4.7 to be maintained indefinitely in order to allow users to transition to QuTiP 5.

- QuTiP are participating in Google Summer of Code 2023 with NumFOCUS ([project ideas](https://github.com/qutip/qutip/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2023)).
